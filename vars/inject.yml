          ---------------------------------
          This directory contains threat actor intelligence
          to support Blue Team analysis and reporting.

          Use these files to:
          - Attribute attacker behavior
          - Validate IOCs
          - Support mitigation recommendations

          Blue Team Guidance:
          Match observed attacker behavior to known TTPs.
          Do not guess attribution — justify it using evidence
          from logs, IOCs, and threat intelligence profiles.
